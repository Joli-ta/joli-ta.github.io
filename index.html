  Welcome! Thank you for stopping by. This is my playground of random little things that I found that helps me learn what overlooked simple problems computers can solve. The answers could be somewhere out there, in pieces or multiple versions. 
</p>

<p>
  My goal here is to organize my thoughts of what I found helpful. It is all a constant learning experience, shared here. With love.
